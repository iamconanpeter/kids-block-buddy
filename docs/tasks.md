# Kids Block Buddy — Task Plan (Plan Mode Only)

**Important:** This file defines planning and readiness tasks only.  
**No coding starts until explicit sign-off is granted.**

---

## 0) Mandatory Gate (Stop Condition)

- [ ] **PLAN SIGN-OFF GATE**: `docs/spec.md`, `docs/technical-plan.md`, and `docs/tasks.md` reviewed and explicitly approved.
- [ ] Stakeholder confirms selected concept: **Block Buddy Village**.
- [ ] Safety constraints and no-chat policy approved.

> ✅ **Implementation may begin only after all gate items above are checked.**  
> ❌ If not approved, remain in planning mode and revise docs only.

---

## 1) Product & Design Alignment Tasks

- [ ] Validate age-band assumptions (7–9 vs 10–12) with examples.
- [ ] Finalize first-session onboarding beats (target: first success in <8 minutes).
- [ ] Confirm mission-card taxonomy (build, decorate, help NPC, collect).
- [ ] Lock fairness charter language and reward transparency rules.
- [ ] Define parent-facing safety screen copy and structure.

Deliverable: approved gameplay and UX ruleset.

---

## 2) Technical Pre-Work Tasks (Still No Implementation)

- [ ] Confirm engine/render approach and module boundaries.
- [ ] Define save format schema + migration strategy.
- [ ] Finalize adaptive difficulty input signals and tuning thresholds.
- [ ] Draft analytics event list with privacy minimization.
- [ ] Establish performance budget targets by device tier.

Deliverable: technical readiness checklist with clear acceptance criteria.

---

## 3) Content Planning Tasks

- [ ] Draft district roadmap (v1 core districts + post-launch themes).
- [ ] Define block set progression and unlock pacing.
- [ ] Create mission template library with difficulty tags.
- [ ] Define weekly/daily optional objective pool.
- [ ] Prepare content quality rubric to avoid repetitive tasks.

Deliverable: content matrix for first content season.

---

## 4) Safety, Compliance, and Parent Trust Tasks

- [ ] Confirm no external comm pathways in child mode.
- [ ] Define parent gate interaction flow and edge cases.
- [ ] Specify data deletion/export behavior (clear and reversible where possible).
- [ ] Write plain-language privacy summary.
- [ ] Create safety QA checklist for release sign-off.

Deliverable: parent-trust policy package.

---

## 5) QA Planning Tasks

- [ ] Define unit/integration/performance test strategy per subsystem.
- [ ] Draft first-session test scripts (usability and comprehension).
- [ ] Prepare save-corruption and recovery test scenarios.
- [ ] Define device matrix (low/mid/high Android targets).
- [ ] Draft accessibility verification checklist.

Deliverable: QA plan ready before coding kickoff.

---

## 6) Implementation Kickoff Instructions (Post-Sign-Off Only)

After gate approval:
- Use **Codex model:** `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Use **effort mode:** **high-effort**
- Build in vertical slices with tests from day one.
- Keep safety constraints as hard requirements, not backlog extras.

---

## 7) Tracking Notes

- Current phase: **Planning Track (No Code Yet)**
- Selected concept: **Block Buddy Village**
- Next immediate action: collect sign-off on all plan artifacts
